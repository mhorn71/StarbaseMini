Note : The UI is created using QT Designer on Xubuntu.  To generate the py file from the ui you
       would normally use pyuic4 however since PyQt5-dev-tools version 4.11.4 setMargins isn't
       set, apparently this is depreciated, to get around this use pyside-uic instead and manually
       the file to import PyQt5 instead of PySide.
