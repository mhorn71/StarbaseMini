getData attempts to create chart even if no data is present to create it from

xml_utils instrument importer needs to check the XML is valid more.


#  Major issue ....   instruments loader requires the XML to be specified, I need to return both local and base instrument
  names ... yikkies ... here be dragons.

QTableWidget won't allow you to select line to copy.

Instrument attributes only initiates correctly on start, unless I reinit the class after UI load.


List to do ...

DataTranslator

MetaDataContructor

MetaDataDeconstructor.

Importer


When get run getData we copy the data blocks sent from the controller to  :  RawDataBlocks and set

		RawDataBlocksAvailable = True
		DataSource = ‘instrument’

Once we run the the RawDataBlocks through the data translator successfully we set  : RawData

		RawDataBlocksAvailable = False
		RawDataSaved = False

Instrument Attributes and Application Configuration detect change on Windows 10 even when change hasn't occurred.

Staribus2Starinet doesn't autodetect instrument when configuration is changed only when app is restarted.
