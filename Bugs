Execute still stores signal if pressed while Application is processing command.

xml_utils instrument importer needs to check the XML is valid more.


List to do ...


When get run getData we copy the data blocks sent from the controller to  :  RawDataBlocks and set

		RawDataBlocksAvailable = True
		DataSource = ‘instrument’

Once we run the the RawDataBlocks through the data translator successfully we set  : RawData

		RawDataBlocksAvailable = False
		RawDataSaved = False


Version 3.0.0 Bugs

Metadata says not saved when in fact it is.
