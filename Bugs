List to do ...

xml_utils instrument importer needs to check the XML is valid more.


When get run getData we copy the data blocks sent from the controller to  :  RawDataBlocks and set

		RawDataBlocksAvailable = True
		DataSource = ‘instrument’

Once we run the the RawDataBlocks through the data translator successfully we set  : RawData

		RawDataBlocksAvailable = False
		RawDataSaved = False

Two menu icons are causing sRGB profile error, find and fix them.
