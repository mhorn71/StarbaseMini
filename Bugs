OSX Dock application doesn't maximise when icon is clicked.

Load RawData and ProcessedData viewer data once only each run, maybe run data parse in separate thread?

Add zoom out to chart if we can.



List to do ...

xml_utils instrument importer needs to check the XML is valid more.


When get run getData we copy the data blocks sent from the controller to  :  RawDataBlocks and set

		RawDataBlocksAvailable = True
		DataSource = ‘instrument’

Once we run the the RawDataBlocks through the data translator successfully we set  : RawData

		RawDataBlocksAvailable = False
		RawDataSaved = False
