Module Overview.

DaoProcessor
------------
Initialise DaoProcessor with the following parameters in order:

serial_port = The serial port too which the instrument is attached,as defined in
              the application configuration.

serial_baudrate = The serial port baudrate as defined in the application
                  configuration.

serial_timeout = The serial port timeout as defined in the application
                 configuration this is also used as the Starinet    timeout as
                 well. It should really be called dao_timeout not serial port.

starinet_address = The IPv4 address of Starinet Instrument as defined in the
                   Instrument XML.

starinet_port = The network port to send Starinet UDP Packets too, as defined
                in the Instrument XML.

stream = The type of stream we want to use, i.e Starinet or Staribus.

This raises an IOError in the event the particular set stream can be initialised.

DaoProcessor.star_message
-------------------------
The method for sending a Staribus Message to the initialised instrument.

Each time the method is called the following parameter need to be provided.

Instrument address = Both Staribus and Starinet use an instrument address though
                     Starinet always uses the address 000, Addresses 254 and 255
                     are reserved for Discovery and Not Assigned respectively.

Command Code Base =  The module base code.

Command Code = The command code itself.

Command Variant = The command variant at present is used internally to the
                  application but is used by the Instrument controller.  It's
                  currently used by the UKRAA Futurlec controller to distinguish
                  the number of channels being sampled.

Command Parameter = The parameter of choice as supplied by the user though the UI
                    interface as well as Blocked and Stepped Commands.

star_message returns a tuple, (status, payload)

Payload can be None

Status can return the following errors : ERROR, CRC_ERROR, MALFORMED_RESPONSE,
                                         TIMEOUT

The Module raises IOError in the event of stream error.

================================================================================
Note these shouldn't be called directly but are described for information only.

StaribusCommandMessage
----------------------

Constructs a fully formed Staribus message from the following supplied
parameters.

Instrument Address =  The address supplied in the range 000 - 253 which is
                      converted to a hex bytes. e.g. 000 = 00

Command Code Base = The command code base which should be a hex byte.

Command Code = The command code which should be a hex byte.

Command Variant = The command variant should be a hex word.

Parameter = The choice or parameter required by the instrument controller.

Returns Staribus message including crc and control characters.

If a message can not be constructed 'MALFORMED_MESSAGE' string will be returned.

See http://www.ukraa.com/www/downloads.html staribus_specification.pdf

StaribusResponseMessage
-----------------------

Deconstructs a Staribus packet.

The entire packet including control characters is required for decipher to work.

Control characters STX, EOT CRLF are removed.  CRC is checked.

Returns: tuple consisting of Status message string and payload.

Payload can be None.

Will return 'MALFORMED_RESPONSE' string if unable decipher response or CRC_ERROR
if crc check fails as Status message.

================================================================================
Notes:

To change the controller speed of the UKRAA Futurlec controller you need to send,

10 * Ctrl-B

It'll responded with a menu where the following menu item are available,

Press 1 9600
Press 2 19200
Press 3 38400
Press 4 57600
Press 5 115200

Doing a controller hard reset we think resets the baudrate to 57600???

Probably still need to update docstrings. ;-))
