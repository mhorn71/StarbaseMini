I've formatted the X axis to display dates as below,

 22:30:13
2015-06-23

While fmt_xdata is formatted as below,

x=22:30:13 y=159.000

I'm not sure what'll happen if a user implements a data translator that uses and Indexed X Axis instead of Datetime.4


-------------------

Note may more to using PyQtGraph instead of matplotlib
