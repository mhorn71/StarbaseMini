Notes.

Application config and logs
---------------------------
The Application configuration and logs are stored in the user home directory in either of the following locations.

Linux / Mac OSX : /Users/<username>/.starbasemini

Windows :  C:\users\<username>\AppData\Local\StarbaseMini\

Instrument Config
-----------------

The Instrument configuration is stored within the application folders instrument directory in XML.

    Instrument XML Keys
    -------------------
    If you add additional XML keys you'll need to adjust xmlLoad.py and loader.py.  Be careful adding new XML as xmlLoad
    returns a list which is used to populate the GUI combo boxes, button etc.

To load the instrument add the instrument to instrumentChooser.py note the names must match name set in .conf and
include the path relative to application base path.

User Interface
--------------
Note the user interface is built using QT 4 and qt-designer
