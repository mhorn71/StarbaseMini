including the current log being written too.

Instrument Config
-----------------

The Instrument configuration is stored within the application folders instrument directory in XML.

    Instrument XML Keys
    -------------------
    If you add additional XML keys you'll need to adjust xmlLoad.py and loader.py.  Be careful adding new XML as xmlLoad
    returns a list which is used to populate the GUI combo boxes, button etc.

To load the instrument, add the instrument to instruments.xml, the Name in instruments is used is to select the
instrument in the configuration manager tool.
