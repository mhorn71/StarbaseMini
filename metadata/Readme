When you add a new datatranslator i.e not Staribus Block you will need to add a new metadata creator for that translator.

Channel 1 is the temperature while the data channels start from channel 2 but are referenced in metadata as Channels 0 - 8

Currently the only metadata that is used is the Observation, Observer and Observatory.
