Running average

You can use any number of points from 2 up, you drop one each time and add the newest as you increment.

X(i)= (X(i-3)+X(i-2)+X(i-1)+X(i))/4

---------------------------------------------

Weighted running average

Gives more weight to newest samples

X(i)= (0.3*X(i-3)+0.5*X(i-2)+0.7*X(i-1)+X(i))/4

---------------------------------------------

Non-linear static remover

Takes 4 samples and only uses the lowest value...assumes others contaminated by static crashes on VLF .....avoids the
error of averaging the crashes which are not required signal, using averaging or "time constant"


X(4*i) = MIN(X(i)..X(i+4))

---------------------------------------------

Peak extractor

Bit dubious needs playing with picks out sudden changes from the filtered average,may need a lot of samples in the
running average to work well. "predicts" next value from average of old data and shows difference to predicted value.
Might run better with a reverse weighted average i.e giving less weight to most recent sample (cos it might be start of
a flare)


X(i) = X(i)-running average


Some of these need careful programming.....if you have N samples, you have to be careful where you start filtering or
you get out of bounds array errors. i.e for i = 3 to N for running average above.
