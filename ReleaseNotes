2.0.4

Fixed -  Upgrade detect bug where the routine couldn't distinguish between 32 and 64 bit Windows versions.
Fixed -  Status Window header size wasn't being set by CSS for some reason so the size change is now set by QtDesigner.
Fixed -  Configuration updater wasn't running, when configuration change detected.
