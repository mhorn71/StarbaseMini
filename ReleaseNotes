2.0.4

Fixed -  Application upgrade notification bug where the routine couldn't distinguish between 32 and 64 bit Windows versions.
Fixed -  Status Window header size wasn't being set by CSS for some reason so the size change is now set by QtDesigner.
Fixed -  Configuration updater wasn't running, when configuration change detected.
Fixed -  Instrument attributes confirm pop up appeared even when save pressed.

Update - Added timer so the application upgrade notification check waits 750 milliseconds
         before running this allows time for the main UI to appear.

Update - Added ability to be able to turn on or off application upgrade notification check.
Update - Changed pop ups which indicate a warning from QMessagebox.question to QMessagebox.warning.
Update - Completely rewrote the configuration tool, pop ups should now appear when data has changed, save button should
         be disabled is configuration isn't valid.  A pop up alert will appear is you set both the relay and staribus to
